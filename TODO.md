## üêõ Current Bugs (To Fix)

### Critical - Recording Quality Issues
- [ ] **Background not rendered in recording** - Background shows in preview but not in final video
- [ ] **Webcam quality very low in recording** - Camera feed appears low resolution/quality
- [ ] **Webcam position/rendering broken** - Shows as semicircle, wrong position, missing borders
- [ ] **Webcam performance very slow/laggy** - Preview updates slowly, not smooth

### UI/UX Issues
- [ ] **Chevron buttons look ugly** - Remove chevrons, make backgrounds naturally scrollable
- [ ] **Webcam preview not showing in main preview** - Circle camera preview doesn't appear in preview area

### Recently Fixed (Partially Working)
- [x] **Recording now saves files** - Videos create successfully using temp directory + Save As
- [x] **Video playback works** - Recorded videos play in completion dialog
- [x] **File size detection** - Proper file size shown in completion dialog

## üìã Remaining Features (Not Implemented)

### Milestone 4 - Interaction Tracking (Optional)
- [ ] Global mouse click detection
- [ ] Visual click animations (rings/pulses)
- [ ] Cursor trail effects
- [ ] Keyboard activity detection
- **Note**: Requires Accessibility API permissions and significant additional code

### Milestone 5 - Intelligent Zoom (Optional)
- [ ] Detect user inactivity
- [ ] Smooth zoom transitions to active areas
- [ ] Maintain window centering during zoom
- [ ] Configurable zoom parameters
- **Note**: Complex feature requiring gesture recognition and animation system

## üß™ Testing Status

### ‚úÖ User-Confirmed Working
- Window selection with thumbnails
- Recording start/stop controls
- Output folder management
- Camera permissions with proper entitlements
- System Settings > Camera shows app correctly

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs User Testing
- [ ] Webcam overlay in actual recording
- [ ] Video file creation and playback
- [ ] File size display accuracy
- [ ] Background color selection UX
- [ ] Custom folder selection
- [ ] Preview window sizing and scaling

### üîß Technical Testing Required
- [ ] Long recordings (>10 minutes)
- [ ] Different window sizes and aspect ratios
- [ ] Multiple displays support
- [ ] System performance during recording
- [ ] Disk space handling when full
- [ ] Permission revocation handling

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities (Critical Bugs)
1. **Fix Background Rendering in Recording** - Background shows in preview but not in recorded video
2. **Fix Webcam Rendering Pipeline** - Webcam shows as semicircle, wrong position, missing borders, very slow
3. **Improve Webcam Quality** - Low quality camera feed in recording
4. **Fix Webcam Preview Visibility** - Webcam not appearing in main preview area
5. **Simplify Background Scrolling UI** - Remove ugly chevron buttons, make naturally scrollable

### Debug Information
- Recording saves to temp directory successfully
- Video file is created and playable
- Preview shows correct composition (window + background + webcam)
- Recording shows ONLY window (no background, broken webcam)
- Issue likely in RecordingEngine.swift composition pipeline

### Future Enhancements (If Desired)
1. Implement basic click detection (Milestone 4 lite version)
2. Add export preset UI (Milestone 6 partial)
3. Add keyboard shortcuts for recording control
4. Improve error handling and user feedback
5. Add recording history/management

## üìù Notes

- **Architecture**: Clean MVVM with SwiftUI
- **Performance**: 60fps target with hardware acceleration (Metal/Core Image)
- **Compatibility**: macOS 13+ required (ScreenCaptureKit)
- **Storage**: Videos saved to ~/Movies/EasyDemo by default
- **Quality**: 20Mbps H.264, high quality preset
- **Privacy**: All processing done locally, no cloud/network

## üöÄ Project Status
