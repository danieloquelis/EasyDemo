# EasyDemo

A free, open-source screen recorder for macOS. Professional-quality recordings shouldn't be behind a paywall.

## Description

**EasyDemo** is a macOS-native screen recording application built with Swift and SwiftUI that captures selected windows with custom backgrounds and webcam overlays, producing high-quality local recordings similar to Screen Studio or Loom—but completely free.

Born from the frustration of screen recorders being locked behind paywalls, EasyDemo provides creators, developers, and everyone a styled and quick way to record their screen without subscription fees or usage limits.

The app is designed with an **offline-first** philosophy—everything is processed locally using Apple frameworks (ScreenCaptureKit, AVFoundation, Core Image). No data leaves your device, ensuring complete privacy and security.

### Core Principles

- **Offline-first:** All processing happens locally—no cloud, no external dependencies
- **Native UX:** Built entirely with Swift + SwiftUI, tightly integrated with macOS
- **Professional Output:** Exported videos are high-quality and polished
- **Simplicity:** Choose window → customize → record → export
